---

The repository contains code comparisons across popular programming languages.
The languages I cover (at this time) include Java, C, Python, C#, R, PHP, JavaScript, and Ruby.
C++ (C++11, specifically) will make special appearances when standard C is not desirable for the task.

I picked these 8 (and sometimes 9) languages because they were highlighted in http://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/software/the-2015-top-ten-programming-languages[an IEEE Spectrum article], "The 2015 Top Ten Programming Languages."
As for number ten, MATLAB, I am still on the fence.
MATLAB is not free to use like the other languages.
GNU Octave is a free MATLAB clone that is kind of compatible, and kind of not.
My leaning right now is to exclude MATLAB unless I come across a compelling reason otherwise.

I try to keep the scope of the code comparisons small.
My intent is not to translate entire programs wholesale, but rather to demonstrate through juxtaposition how specific constructs are done differently in each of the languages.
That said, if you have a request for a specific code comparison, let me know and I will try to accommodate.

## Supported Languages

## Directory Structure

|===
| /fundamentals | Programs that demonstrate the fundamentals of each programming language.
| /builtins | Programs that demonstrate functionality that is built-in to one or more of the languages.
| /simple-algorithms | Programs that demonstrate simple algorithms implemented in the different programming languages.
| /advanced-algorithms | Programs that demonstrate advanced algorithms implemented in the different programming languages.
